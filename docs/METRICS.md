# Dashboard Metrics — how every number is calculated

How each card and chart gets its number, in plain terms. Written page by
page as we verify them; anything not listed here has not been reviewed yet.

**Rule we follow:** one business concept = one definition, in one place.
If the same label appears on two pages it must resolve to the same
function, never be recomputed separately. That is what caused the
"Strategic Pool showed 1 on Home and 3 on HR Home" bug.

**Where the rules live:**

| What | Where | Who can change it |
|---|---|---|
| What a valid upload looks like (columns, types) | `backend/app/services/validation/configs/*.yaml` | Config edit, no code |
| Which column plays which role, and what each card counts | `backend/app/services/configs/roster_metrics.yaml` | Config edit, no code |
| What the values *mean* (status, seniority keywords, hours labels) | `backend/app/services/configs/*_metrics.yaml` | Config edit, no code |
| Date-window logic (joiners, exits, attrition) | `backend/app/services/roster_metrics.py` | Developer |

### Column roles

Metrics never reference a raw column heading; they reference a **role**,
resolved through config:

| Role | Column |
|---|---|
| `employee_id` | `NEW_EMP_ID` |
| `employee_name` | `NAME` |
| `designation` | `Designation` |
| `client` | `Client` |

**Headings that carry a reporting period.** The client column used to be
exported as `Client as on June 2026` — a heading that changes every
month, which would have failed the required-column check on every new
export. Two things now protect against that:

1. The source has been changed to export a stable `Client` heading.
2. The contract also matches the old shape by **pattern**
   (`matches: "Client as on .*"`) and renames it to `Client` on read.

So `Client`, `Client as on June 2026`, `Client as on July 2026` and any
future period are all accepted, with no config or code change. Older
files already uploaded keep working. Locked in by
`test_client_column_heading_may_carry_any_period`.

Use the same `matches:` mechanism for any other heading that starts
carrying a date.

### The app is not case-sensitive

Values that differ only by capitalisation are treated as the same value.
This matters because casing used to fail **silently**:

| If the source were typed... | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `Status` in lower case | every headcount card read **0** | correct |
| `Booked Hours Type` in lower case | donut **empty** | correct |
| `Region` mixed case | `EMEA` and `emea` as two bars | one bar |

22 columns are marked `normalize_case: true` (14 roster, 8 booking) —
every column used for an equality comparison or a group-by.

Variants fold onto a **canonical spelling** rather than being re-cased,
because blunt title-casing would mangle the acronyms this data is full of
(`GCC` → "Gcc", `EMEA` → "Emea"):

1. Columns compared by equality declare `canonical_values` — `Status`,
   `Type`, `Reason for Leaving`, `Booked Hours Type`. So even a file
   typed entirely in lower case resolves to `"Active"`, because the
   correct spelling comes from config rather than from the file.
2. Every other column folds to the **most common spelling already in the
   file**, which preserves acronyms exactly as the business writes them.

This is applied at ingestion, so it protects cards, charts, filters and
group-bys alike.

**Not reported to the admin.** `"EMEA"` and `"emea"` unambiguously mean
the same thing, so nothing is guessed and there is nothing to act on —
flagging it would be noise about a problem already solved. It is logged
server-side for traceability. Contrast with a defaulted blank, which
*does* assert a fact the file didn't contain and is warned about.

## Data sources

| Source | File | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| Roster | `DEPT - Master Data(Sheet1).xlsx` | Headcount, status, seniority, experience |
| Booking | `UTILIZATION DATA SHEET.xlsx` | Hours, client vs internal utilization |
| Ground truth | `PowerBI_Ready_Utilization_May_2026.xlsx` | Utilization Overview page |

The dashboard always reads the **latest promoted upload**; if nothing has
been uploaded it falls back to the bundled file.

## Page 1 — Home

Current values are from the roster of 52 rows / booking of 2,961 rows
(2026-07-22) and are shown only to make the rules concrete.

### Card: Active Employees — `35`
Employees whose **`Status` = "Active"**, counted as distinct `NEW_EMP_ID`.

### Card: Strategic Pool — `3`
Employees whose **`Status` = "Strategic Pool"**, counted as distinct
`NEW_EMP_ID`.

> Previously this was "employees with a blank `DOJ (DEPT)`", which is why
> Home (1) and HR Home (3) disagreed. It is now the `Status` column only,
> and every surface calls the same function.

### Card: Closing Headcount — `38`
**Everyone who had joined by the end of the period and is still part of
the workforce.**

- Joined = `DOJ (DEPT)` on or before the period end (a blank joining date
  still counts — the person is here, the date just wasn't recorded)
- Still here = `Status` is **Active or Strategic Pool**. **Inactive
  employees are never counted**, whether or not they have a last working
  day.

So Closing Headcount always equals Active + Strategic Pool (35 + 3 = 38).

> Previously this counted anyone without an `LWD` date, so 9 employees
> marked Inactive but missing an LWD were still counted as present — the
> card read 47 while the donut on the same page read 38.

### Chart: Month-wise Workforce Growth
Closing Headcount (rule above) computed at the end of **each month**, so
the line is purely cumulative by joining date: if May closes at 34 and 4
people join in June, June closes at 38. It never dips, because leavers
are excluded from every month rather than removed at their exit date.

Current: Jul-25 `2` → Aug `4` → Sep `7` → Oct `9` → Nov `11` → Dec `16`
→ Jan-26 `23` → Feb `26` → Mar `30` → Apr `31` → May `34` → Jun `38`.

### Chart: Workforce Category (donut) — `38`
Two slices, both from `Status`: **Active** (35) and **Strategic Pool** (3).

### Chart: Workforce by Seniority (donut) — `38`
Bands come from **keyword matching on the `Seniorirty Level` column**
(the column name's typo is in the source file and is kept deliberately).
First match wins, case-insensitive:

| If the value contains | Band |
|---|---|
| `tbd` | TBD |
| `lead` | Lead |
| `senior` | Senior |
| `mid` | Mid |
| anything else | Other |

Order matters: "Seniority TBD" contains "senior", so `tbd` is tested
first. Keywords are configured in `roster_metrics.yaml` — adding one is a
config edit.

Scope: **current workforce only** (Active + Strategic Pool), so it totals
38 and agrees with the other cards on the page.

Current: Senior `15`, Lead `13`, Mid `5`, TBD `4`, Other `1`.

### Chart: Internal v Client Utilization (donut) — `17.15K` hours
From the **booking** (utilization) sheet. The `Booked Hours Type` column
holds the category; hours are summed from `Employee Booked Hours` for
each one:

| Category (`Booked Hours Type`) | Rows | Sum of `Employee Booked Hours` | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client Hours | 1,929 | **11,433.6** | 66.66% |
| Internal Hours | 1,032 | **5,719.2** | 33.34% |
| **Total** | 2,961 | **17,152.8** | 100% |

The donut's centre figure (`17.15K`) is that total. Verified 2026-07-22
directly against the raw file — Client + Internal equals the total
exactly, so no hours are unaccounted for.

The two category labels are configured in `booking_metrics.yaml`, so
renaming one is a config edit. If a **third** category ever appears
(e.g. "Leave Hours"), those hours would count toward the total but land
in neither slice — the `hours_split_covers_all_hours` invariant catches
exactly that and names the offending category.

## Page 2 — HR Home (HR Portal)

Card definitions are declared in `roster_metrics.yaml` under `cards:`, so
this table and the code read from the same source.

### Card: Total Employees — `52`
Distinct **`employee_id`** (`NEW_EMP_ID`). **No status filter** —
everyone in the file, whether Active, Inactive or Strategic Pool.

**What if an employee has no ID?** A blank `NEW_EMP_ID` is filled at
ingestion with a **numbered** marker — `NEW_EMP_ID TBD 1`,
`NEW_EMP_ID TBD 2`, … — so each such person is still counted once. The
numbering is not cosmetic; with the current roster (2 employees have no
ID) the alternatives both under-count:

| Design | Total Employees | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Leave blank | 50 | distinct-count ignores blanks — both people vanish |
| One shared `"NEW_EMP_ID TBD"` | 51 | both collapse into a single value |
| **Numbered markers** (what we do) | **52** ✅ | each counted once |

Every filled cell is reported as a warning on upload, and
`test_blank_ids_do_not_undercount_headcount` locks the behaviour in.
Those employees display as `NEW_EMP_ID TBD 1` in the Employee Directory
until real IDs are assigned — the count is right, the identifier is a
placeholder.

### Card: Active Employees — `35`
Distinct `employee_id` where `Status` = "Active". **Identical definition
to the Active Employees card on Home** — same function, so the two pages
cannot disagree.

### Card: Departments — `27`
Distinct values of the **`designation`** role (`Designation` column),
case-normalised so `"SalesForce Core Developer"` and `"Salesforce Core
Developer"` count once.

> Note: this counts distinct **job titles**, not organisational
> departments. Confirmed as intended.

### Card: Projects — `31`
Distinct values of the **`client`** role (the `Client` column).

Two behaviours worth knowing, both confirmed as intended:
- Cells can hold several comma-separated clients and the **whole cell**
  counts as one value — `"Barbour, PK Commerce"` is one entry, and
  `"ParsonKelloggs"` vs `"ParsonKelloggs, Barbour"` are two different ones.
- `"Client TBD"` (unallocated) is included.

*(For comparison, the booking sheet's clean one-per-row columns give 49
clients and 81 projects — a different question, answered on the
Utilization pages.)*

### Charts on this page
Status Split, Headcount by Region, Workforce by Working Entity and
Workforce by Experience Band have **not been reviewed yet** — to be
covered when we work through the rest of this page.

## Consistency rules we enforce automatically

Checked by `metric_invariants.py` — in the test suite *and* on every
upload, so a file that would make the dashboard contradict itself is
flagged before it goes live:

1. Strategic Pool is the same number everywhere it appears.
2. Closing Headcount = Active + Strategic Pool.
3. The Workforce-by-Seniority split covers exactly the present workforce.
4. The Status breakdown accounts for every employee (no status silently
   uncounted).
5. Active + Inactive + Strategic Pool = Total Employees.
6. Client Hours + Internal Hours = total booked hours (no hours category
   silently excluded from the donut).

## Known data-quality note

9 employees are marked `Inactive` but have **no `LWD`** (last working
day). This no longer affects headcount, but it does mean they are not
counted as **Exits**, so Exits (5) is lower than Inactive (14) and
attrition is understated. Filling in `LWD` for those rows would resolve
it — a data fix, not a code change. *(Exits/attrition appear on HR
Analytics, not Home — to be reviewed when we get to that page.)*
